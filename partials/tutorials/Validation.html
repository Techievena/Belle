<p>First, I'll explain the validation system in the manifest:
The validation specified in the manifest is for server side only. Client side validation needs to be put into markup (I will write up a whole thing on the full validation process real soon!). Preferably a dev (and ourselves) will setup the same client side validation as the server side validation but the most important validation is server side so people cannot hack stuff.
Each validation item in the validation array specifies a validation type that is executed against the posted value. What this means is that manifest based property editors will generally only be able to store 'simple' values, otherwise are auto-validation will not </p></div>
