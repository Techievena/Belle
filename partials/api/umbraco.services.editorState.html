<div class="current"><p>Returns an object reference to the current editor entity.
the entity is the root object of the editor.
EditorState is used by property/parameter editors that need
access to the entire entity being edited, not just the property/parameter </p>

<p>editorState.current can not be overwritten, you should only read values from it
since modifying individual properties should be handled by the property editors</p></div>

<li><h3 id="reset">reset()</h3>
<div class="reset"><p>Since the editorstate entity is read-only, you cannot set it to null
only through the reset() method</p></div>

<div class="set"><p>Sets the current entity object for the currently active editor
This is only used when implementing an editor with a complex model
