<div class="description"><p>Used to broadcast an event to all elements inside this one to notify that form validation has 
changed. If we don't use this that means you have to put a watch for each directive on a form's validation
changing which would result in much higher processing. We need to actually watch the whole $error collection of a form
because just watching $valid or $invalid doesn't acurrately trigger form validation changing.
This also sets the show-validation (or a custom) css class on the element when the form is invalid - this lets
us css target elements to be displayed when the form is submitting/submitted.
Another thing this directive does is to ensure that any .control-group that contains form elements that are invalid will
be marked with the 'error' css class. This ensures that labels included in that control group are styled correctly.</p></div>
